1) Explain REST and RESTful

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architecture model to create a web service or web API
RESTful is an implementation of the model REST to build a web service using HTTP protocol.

2) Explain the architectural style for the creation of a web API (client server communication, formatting language, etc.)

There is a lot check to do for making a good web API, but the most important for me is follow these rules :
-Use HTTP or HTTPS for client server communication
-Make URI short, easy to understand and not expose language of the code for security.
-Use access token to make sure client is allowed
-Using simple formatting language such as JSON or XML
-Handle errors correctly

3) Explain HTTP requests types when used with RESTful web (GET, PUT, POST, etc.)

HTTP requests are commonly used for CRUD operation in RESTful web architecture:
-POST for CREATE => to create resources
-GET for READ => to get resources
-POST for UPDATE => to update resources
-DELETE for DELETE => to delete resources

4) Explain the difference between stateless and stateful protocol. Which type of protocol is HTTP ?

Stateless protocol do not store status or sessions information of the request
Stateful protocol do store status or sessions information.
HTTP is a stateless protocol, just a single request and response

5) Explain the difference between a GET and a POST (like how are sent the parameters)

GET is used to retrieve data from the server where parameters are inside the request url .
POST is used to send data to the server where parameters are inside the request body.

6) You canâ€™t work out how to solve a coding problem. What do you do to find the answer?

Check stackoverflow to lookup if anyone got the same problems as me and if there is a solution.
If no answer found probably asking team instead of wasting time.
